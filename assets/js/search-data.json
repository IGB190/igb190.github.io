These lenses focus on aspects like gameplay balance, player experience, and system design. Great for refining your ideas and spotting potential issues. The MDA Framework: A well-known framework for understanding how different game design elements interact. It helps you think about the relationship between game mechanics, player behavior (dynamics), and the emotional responses you want to evoke (aesthetics). The Golden Rule of Game Design: This article breaks down the “Golden Rule” of game design: designing with the player’s experience in mind. It provides advice on how to ensure that your game is intuitive, engaging, and enjoyable by prioritizing player feedback and emotions. The Game Maker’s Toolkit YouTube Channel: A YouTube channel by Mark Brown, who explores specific game design elements in detail, like level design, systems, and player psychology. His videos break down examples from real games and provide valuable insights into how game mechanics and narrative are intertwined. The 5 Types of Fun: In this video, Marc LeBlanc discusses the five types of fun: Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, and Fellowship. Understanding these types helps you design games that cater to different player preferences and build deeper, more engaging experiences. The Designer’s Notebook: A collection of articles by seasoned game designers, each offering insights on different elements of game design, from narrative to mechanics to systems design. Each article tackles a specific aspect of creating games and offers actionable advice. Game Accessibility Guidelines: Every game designer should bookmark these guidelines. They go through the principles you should follow and give examples for each task. There’s even a checklist you can download. GDC Vault: The Game Developers Conference adds all the various talks and presentations from their events to their vault. These range from technical advice on how to develop specific ideas to wider trends and best practices. Design Doc This channel answers the tricky, specific questions you might have about game design, focusing on the mechanics themselves. How do you stop people from hoarding items? Why add critical hits? What’s the point of fast travel? . Brackeys: A huge channel of tutorials that also delves into the actual game design decisions behind that development. The only downside is that they shut down a few years ago, so some videos can be a little outdated. ",
