# Core Game Systems
When you are working on a project or on a part of a project that you were not directly involved in creating, it can be challenging to understand how all of the main pieces fit together.

This section of the documentation gives a broad overview of the major game systems to help you become more familiar with the project.

Explore each of the systems below, then look at some of the [IGB190 Guides](../igb190-guides/igb190-guides.html) if you need any guidance during implementation of your extensions.
