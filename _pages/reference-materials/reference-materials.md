## Free ARPGs
- [Path of Exile](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/): A highly popular and complex ARPG known for its deep skill tree and complex loot system. It's free-to-play and often used as a reference for modern ARPG design.

- [Torchlight Infinite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1974050/Torchlight_Infinite/): Torchlight has a more casual, fun style than other ARPGs but still includes a lot of key elements like loot and character progression.

- [Lost Ark](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1599340/): A newer free-to-play ARPG with both a rich narrative and combat similar to the Diablo series. Its diverse character classes and dungeons can help students explore progression systems, combat design, and multiplayer interactions.

- [Diablo III (Starter Edition)](https://diablo3.blizzard.com/en-us/) â€“ While Diablo III is typically a paid game, Blizzard offers a free Starter Edition that lets players experience the game up to level 13. It's a great introduction to ARPGs, featuring a mix of combat, loot, and abilities.
