# IGB190 Guides
To help you develop your project, this section offers several guides specific to the IGB190 ARPG project. These guides align quite closely with the content taught in the workshops. It is **strongly recommended** that you complete the workshop documents as the worksheets provide more guidance related to the unit assessment and motivation for the activities.

After you have completed the worksheets, however, you may find that these guides are easier to use for reference material, due to the clear navigation and search tools.
