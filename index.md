# IGB190 Documentation
This website is intended to provide some helpful guides and resources for the unit **IGB190: Game Mechanics Implementation**. 

In this unit, you will be using the provided tools and packages to build a 10-minute action role-playing game (ARPG). The experience will have a custom player-character, a variety of custom abilities, a selection of item sets with custom abilities, enemies, tilemaps, quests and more.

To help you do this, you will be contributing to a partially-completed project which has many of the core systems already set up. This website aims to help you better understand these systems, and how you can use them to build your intended experience.

Areas you may wish to explore include:

- [Guides](_pages/guides/guides.html): Contains a variety of helpful guides aimed at teaching the basics of various topics.

- [Visual Coding](_pages/visual-coding/visual-coding.html): An overview of the visual coding system available in the experience for creating abilities, items, quests, and general game logic (such as tutorials and bespoke events).

- [Resources](_pages/resources/): Contains helpful resources that will help you develop your project.

- [Reference Materials](_pages/reference-materials/reference-materials.html): Reference materials 
intended to help you get started in building your experience. This provides some game databases, videos, and other content which may help you if you are not familiar with ARPGs.

- [Code Documentation](_pages/documentation/documentation.html): Documentation for the Base Experience that you are developing. This provides an overview of the main scripts (note: you are not expected to understand or interact with these, but this documentation is here if you would like to do so).
